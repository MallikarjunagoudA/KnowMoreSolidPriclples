# KnowMoreSolidPriclples


**Solution to develop a successful application depends on**

**Architecture** => choosing an architecture is the first step in designing application based on the req.

**Design Priniples** => Appkication development process need to follow tht desigh principles

**Design patterns** => We need to choose correct design patterns to build the software.


❤️**SOLID principles**❤️

* SOLID principles are the design pronciples that enable us manage most of the software design problems

* The term SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.


**🌟 WHY SOLID PEINCIPLES**

>>If we don't follow the solid principles we 

=> end up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other modules/applications.

=> Tight coupling causes time to implement any new requirment, features or any bug fixes and some times it creates unkonwn issues.

=> End up with a code which is not testable.

=> End up with duplication of code.

=> End up creating new bugs by fixing another bug.

=> End up with many unknown issues in the application development cycle.



>>**🌟 SOLID PRINCIPLES HELPS US TO**

=> Achieve reduction in complexity of code.

=> Increase readability,extensibility and maintenannce.

=> Reduce error and implement Reusability.

=> Achieve better testability.

=> Reduce tight coupling.

**🌟SOLID Acronym**

S single responsibility principle(SRP) - maintainability

O open closed principle(OSP) - extenability

L Liskov substitution Principle(LSP) - reuability

I Interface segregation Principle(ISP) - flexibility

D Dependency Inversion Priciple(DIP) - loose coupling


>>**🌟single responsibility principle(SRP)**(add sutract mul div calculate example)

Every Module or class should have responsibility over a single part or the functionality provided by the software and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

each class and module should focus on a single task at a time

 everything in the class should be related to that single purpose 

 there can be many members in the class as long as they related to the single responsibility

 with SRP, classes become smaller and clearner

 code is less gragile. 


>>**🌟Liskov substitution Principle(LSP)** (exception for a ocp extension example of bonus for temp permenenet and contract)


 If the program module is using a base class, then the reference to the base class can be replaced with a derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.

 we can also state that derived types must be substitutable for their base types.

 S is subtype of T, then objects of type T may replaecd with objexts of type S.

 derived types must be completly substityable for teir base types.

 liskov substitution principle is a particular definition of a subtypeing relation called (strong) behaviral subtyping.

>>implementation guidlines

=> no new exceptions can be thrown by the subtype.

=>clients should not know which specifix subtype they are calling

=> new derived classes just extend without replacing the fuctionality of old classes.



>>**🌟open closed principle(OCP)**(example of bonus for temp permenenet and contract)

 "The software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  
 The design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code.

 Any new functionality should be implemented by addeding new classes, attribures and methods, instead of changing the current ones or existing ones. 

>>implementation guideline

=>the simplest way to apply OCP is to impllement the new functionality on new derived classes.

=> allow clients to adcess the original class with abstract interface.



why? if not followed then what might will happen?

if not followed

=> End up testing the entire functionality.

=> QA team need to test the entire flow.

=> costly process for the organization.

=> Maintainance overheads increas on the classes.

=> Breaks the SRP.



>>**🌟Interface segregation Principle(ISP)**(printer example)


"**Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface**"

 we should not enforce clients to implement interfaces that they don't use. instead of crating one big interface we van break down it to smaller interfaces

 No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

 one fat interface need to be split to many smaller and relevant interfaces so that clients can know about the interfaces that are relevant to them.







>>**🌟Dependency Inversion Priciple(DIP)**(tightly and loosly coupling repo and irepo and controller.)



 Abstractions should not depend on the details whereas the details should depend on abstractions.

 High-level modules should not depend on low level modules.

 Abstractions should not depends on details. details should depend on abstraction.

 the interaction between high level and low level modules should be thought of as an abstract interaction between them.
