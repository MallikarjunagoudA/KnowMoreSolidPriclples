**Solution to develop a successful application depends on**

>> **Architecture** => choosing an architecture is the first step in designing application based on the req.
>> **Design Priniples** => Appkication development process need to follow tht desigh principles
>>**Design patterns** => We need to choose correct design patterns to build the software.


‚ù§Ô∏è**SOLID principles**‚ù§Ô∏è

‚ù§Ô∏èSOLID principles are the design pronciples that enable us manage most of the software design problems

‚ù§Ô∏èThe term SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.


**üåü WHY SOLID PEINCIPLES**

>>If we don't follow the solid principles we 

=> end up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other modules/applications.
=> Tight coupling causes time to implement any new requirment, features or any bug fixes and some times it creates unkonwn issues.
=> End up with a code which is not testable.
=> End up with duplication of code.
=> End up creating new bugs by fixing another bug.
=> End up with many unknown issues in the application development cycle.


**üåü SOLID PRINCIPLES HELPS US TO**

=> Achieve reduction in complexity of code.
=> Increase readability,extensibility and maintenannce.
=> Reduce error and implement Reusability.
=> Achieve better testability.
=> Reduce tight coupling.

**üåüSOLID Acronym**

>>‚ù§Ô∏èS‚ù§Ô∏è single responsibility principle(SRP) - maintainability
>>‚ù§Ô∏èO‚ù§Ô∏è open closed principle(OSP) - extenability
>>‚ù§Ô∏èL‚ù§Ô∏è Liskov substitution Principle(LSP) - reuability
>>‚ù§Ô∏èI‚ù§Ô∏è Interface segregation Principle(ISP) - flexibility
>>‚ù§Ô∏èD‚ù§Ô∏è Dependency Inversion Priciple(DIP) - loose coupling


>>**üåüsingle responsibility principle(SRP)**(add sutract mul div calculate example)

‚ù§Ô∏è Every Module or class should have responsibility over a single part or the functionality provided by the software and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

‚ù§Ô∏è each class and module should focus on a single task at a time

‚ù§Ô∏è everything in the class should be related to that single purpose 

‚ù§Ô∏è there can be many members in the class as long as they related to the single responsibility

‚ù§Ô∏è with SRP, classes become smaller and clearner

‚ù§Ô∏è code is less gragile. 


**üåüLiskov substitution Principle(LSP)** (exception for a ocp extension example of bonus for temp permenenet and contract)


‚ù§Ô∏è If the program module is using a base class, then the reference to the base class can be replaced with a derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.

‚ù§Ô∏è we can also state that derived types must be substitutable for their base types.

‚ù§Ô∏è S is subtype of T, then objects of type T may replaecd with objexts of type S.

‚ù§Ô∏è derived types must be completly substityable for teir base types.

‚ù§Ô∏è liskov substitution principle is a particular definition of a subtypeing relation called (strong) behaviral subtyping.

>>implementation guidlines

=> no new exceptions can be thrown by the subtype.
=>clients should not know which specifix subtype they are calling
=> new derived classes just extend without replacing the fuctionality of old classes.






**üåüopen closed principle(OCP)**(example of bonus for temp permenenet and contract)

‚ù§Ô∏è "The software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  
‚ù§Ô∏è The design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code.

‚ù§Ô∏è Any new functionality should be implemented by addeding new classes, attribures and methods, instead of changing the current ones or existing ones. 

>>implementation guidelines
=>the simplest way to apply OCP is to impllement the new functionality on new derived classes.
=> allow clients to adcess the original class with abstract interface.


why? if not followed then what might will happen?
if not followed
=> End up testing the entire functionality.
=> QA team need to test the entire flow.
=> costly process for the organization.
=> Maintainance overheads increas on the classes.
=> Breaks the SRP.



**üåüInterface segregation Principle(ISP)**(printer example)



‚ù§Ô∏è"**Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface**"

‚ù§Ô∏è we should not enforce clients to implement interfaces that they don't use. instead of crating one big interface we van break down it to smaller interfaces

‚ù§Ô∏è No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

‚ù§Ô∏è one fat interface need to be split to many smaller and relevant interfaces so that clients can know about the interfaces that are relevant to them.







**üåüDependency Inversion Priciple(DIP)**(tightly and loosly coupling repo and irepo and controller.)



‚ù§Ô∏è Abstractions should not depend on the details whereas the details should depend on abstractions.

‚ù§Ô∏è High-level modules should not depend on low level modules.

‚ù§Ô∏è Abstractions should not depends on details. details should depend on abstraction.

‚ù§Ô∏è the interaction between high level and low level modules should be thought of as an abstract interaction between them.
